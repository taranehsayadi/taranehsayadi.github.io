title: Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis

# UQ
Simulations of unsteady solid fuel particle combustion involve a variety of complex phenomena, 
which can be numerically predicted using models with varying levels of fidelity. These models 
in turn rely on parameters obtained from experiments or small-scale simulations. It is 
therefore essential to quantify the uncertainties in the prediction of different quantities 
of interest with respect to these model parameters to ensure robustness. This is particularly 
important when combustion under different freestream compositions (for example, air or oxy 
atmospheres) are analyzed. The first step is to determine the most sensitive parameters of 
the model. However the large dimension of the parameter space makes traditional methods such 
as finite difference (brute force) unfeasible. This work addressed this bottleneck by employing 
a semi-discrete adjoint method to determine sensitivities. This study also examines the 
evolution of these sensitivities in time for a single unsteady axisymmetric particle undergoing 
devolatilization, where a methane mechanism is used to the gas phase chemical reactions. 
The dominant model parameters are identified for several quantities of interest, including 
particle temperature and burning rate, and under two freestream compositions (i.e. air and oxy atmospheres). 
Additionally, the impact of various devolatilization models on the extracted sensitivities 
is analyzed. In addition to sensitivities, an adjoint-based active sub-space method (AASM) 
Hassan et al. (2023) is also utilized to quantify the underlying uncertainties in the predictions. 
This provides a general assessment of model predictability with respect to the identified 
quantities of interest. Using AASM uncertainties are extracted for both air and oxy atmospheres 
and compared in the context of a single particle undergoing devolatilization. Comparisons 
reveal that particle parameters yield significantly greater uncertainties and sensitivities 
than gas phase reaction rates. Additionally, model parameter uncertainties are larger in the 
oxy atmosphere than in air, highlighting the impact of the freestream composition on the 
resulting predictions. Novelty and significance statement Quantifying the uncertainties 
and sensitivities associated with solid fuel combustion model parameters is unfeasible using 
traditional methods due to the large number of model parameters, which is known as the 
"curse of dimensionality" However, by combining adjoint techniques with dimension reduction 
approaches in a single method, AASM, this issue can be overcome. AASM offers a general assessment 
of model predictability for various quantities of interest (QoIs), defining the most sensitive 
parameters in a global context rather than a local one, and shows the time evolution of 
uncertainties for these QoIs in different atmospheric conditions, revealing the role of the 
free-stream composition on the resulting predictions.
